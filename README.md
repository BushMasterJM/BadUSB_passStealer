# BadUSB_passStealer

## Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
Everything in this repository is **strictly** for educational purposes. **I am not responsible** for any stolen data. **You are responsible** for your actions when using this script for **BadUSB**.

## About ‚ÑπÔ∏è
This **script** allows you to steal the following **information**:
* Browser **passwords** (Chrome, Firefox, Opera);
* **WiFi** passwords;
* Browser **history** from the last 7 days
* A **list** of all **devices** connected to the victim's network

### Attention Arduino users!
I stopped upgrading .ino scripts. If you want, you can convert Ducky Scripts [here](https://duckify.huhn.me/).

### NB #1 (for Arduino BadUSB)
Sometimes, you will see something like this:
```cpp
Keyboard.press(KEY_LEFT_CTRL);
Keyboard.press(KEY_LEFT_ALT);
Keyboard.press(173);
Keyboard.releaseAll();
```
This is used to type characters like "@" and "\\". However, it depends on the computer's keyboard layout, so adapt these characters using this [site](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/portal/help/theory/ascii.txt) and the sequence you actually use to type them. Alternatively, switch the keyboard layout to French.

### US Layout
For a US layout, use the following replacements:
For "\\":
```
Keyboard.press(92);
Keyboard.releaseAll();
```
For "@":
```
Keyboard.press(64);
Keyboard.releaseAll();
```

### NB #2
You can customize the **delay** according to how fast you plug in the **BadUSB**.

### NB #3
When you plug the BadUSB into a PC, you must wait for the Caps Lock to flash before unplugging it.

# Getting Started ‚úîÔ∏è

## Requirements
1. A **BadUSB**.
2. Install **Arduino software** [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (if using an Arduino-based BadUSB).
